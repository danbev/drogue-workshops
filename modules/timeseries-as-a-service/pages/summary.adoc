= Conclusion

With a few managed services, you can create an end-to-end IoT scenario. Ingesting the data using MQTT, delivering it
to a Knative serverless endpoint, storing it in a time-series database, and visualizing it. All with open source, and
yet managed for you.

Of course, I would encourage you to get everything deployed locally. Just to see that you can indeed self-host
all of this. You can also try to swap out components and service offerings, as it is an open architecture.

== What's next?

Using the same mechanism, you could of course push the data also do another service. Or maybe enrich or pre-process
it using a Knative serverless function. Maybe build some application on top of the Timescale database, now that
you have some data.
