= Wait, there is more!

CAUTION: WORK IN PROGRESS!

We got a nice IoT example set up. What we are missing, is data. So, let's generate some and see what we can do with
it.

== Generating data

Of course, you can set up a device and publish real data to the device you configured. However, explaining this may
take some time, and we would like to keep this example focused on part of processing the data on the cloud side.

So, for this workshop we are using our device simulator. Clicking on the following link, will open the simulator
in your browser. It will simulate a device using MQTT over websocket, and comes pre-configured with a sine wave
generator, which generates an artificial temperature value.

NOTE: You will need to update the device credentials (application, device id, password) on the connection screen
after loading.

== Update credentials

Update the credentials on the "Connection" page. Activate them by pressing the btn:[Apply] button.

[NOTE]
.Persisting configuration
====
By default, all changes made to the simulator instance are temporary. Closing the browser tab will simply discard them.

If you want to persist the changes, you can store one configuration as default. Navigate to the "Configuration" page,
and click on the btn:[Set as default] button.
====

== Start the connection

In order to let the simulator send data, you need to start the connection by pressing on the btn:[â–¶] button in the top
right navigation area.

== Send data

Once the simulator is connected, it will start sending data towards the system with a 250ms update period. You should
also see the data coming in the Grafana dashboard.

Keep the simulator running for a while, and don't close the tab. Maybe grab a coffee and check out the data when you
come back.

Maybe also disconnect the simulator for a few minutes, and reconnect it afterwards, letting it push some more data
(simulating a gap in the data too)

== Improving the dashboard query

Now that we have more data pushed to TimescaleDB, let's focus on the dashboard query a bit. The current query we have
in Grafana is a pretty basic one. Great to get started, but TimescaleDB can do way better.

Let's take a look at the following query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT $__timeGroup("time", $__interval, NULL), device_id as metric, avg(avg(temperature)) OVER w as temp
FROM temperatures
WHERE
  $__timeFilter("time") AND
  device_id = ANY(ARRAY[$device_id]::varchar[])
GROUP BY time, device_id
WINDOW w as (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY time RANGE '1 minute'::INTERVAL PRECEDING)
ORDER BY time, device_id
----

CAUTION: Prevents duplicate time entries. But re-runs average.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT time, metric, avg(temp) FROM (

SELECT $__timeGroup("time", $__interval, NULL), device_id AS metric, avg(avg(temperature)) OVER w AS temp
FROM temperatures
WHERE
  $__timeFilter("time") AND
  device_id = ANY(ARRAY[$device_id]::varchar[])
GROUP BY time, device_id
WINDOW w as (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY time RANGE '1 minute'::INTERVAL PRECEDING)
ORDER BY time, device_id

) grouped_temps
GROUP BY time, metric
----

In a nutshell, this query takes the data, and builds a moving average over a time period of 1 minute. Portioning the
data by device, so that the moving average is build for each device, instead of over all devices. It will also not just
skip gaps, but actively report them using `NULL` as value. This can be used in Grafana to make the user aware of
the gaps, rather than just drawing a straight line.

In addition to the existing query, add a new panel in the Grafana dashboard. Using the query from above. Apply and
save, and then take a look at the different visualization of the data:

image::more-grafana-moving-average.png[Screenshot of moving average]

You can see that the measurement is much smoother now. Still, internally you have the actual, raw data available. Also,
it is pretty easy to spot the gap in the data. In both variants. Bust just assume how that would look if the data
would not be in such a predictable pattern. You might actually miss if the sensor value is a flat line, or if it was a
gap in the data.

== Better partitioning

Of course, in the background, TimescaleDB knows how to best optimize the data and queries. By transforming the standard
table into a "hypertable" earlier on, we allowed the database to create chunks of data, grouped by time. When building
a Grafana dashboard, showing the last 30 minutes of data, some chunks might not even be touched when collecting
the data.

However, we can do even better. Remember that we allow the user to filter by device, and also used the "device id"
when partitioning the data for the moving average. We could add the device ID as an additional portioning dimension.

Execute the following statement using the `psql` tool:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE temperatures2
(
    time            TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,

    device_id       VARCHAR(64)              NOT NULL,

    temperature     DOUBLE PRECISION         NOT NULL
);

SELECT create_hypertable('temperatures2', 'time', partitioning_column => 'device_id', number_partitions => 3);
INSERT INTO temperatures2 (SELECT * FROM temperatures);

-- now swap tables
ALTER TABLE temperatures RENAME TO temperatures_old;
ALTER TABLE temperatures2 RENAME TO temperatures;
DROP TABLE temperatures_old;

GRANT INSERT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO pusher;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dashboard;
----

== Materializing queries

[source,sql]
----
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW temperature_summary_minute
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
   time_bucket_gapfill(INTERVAL '1 minute', time, NULL) AS ts,
   device_id,
   AVG(temperature) as temperature
FROM temperatures
GROUP BY ts, device_id;

SELECT add_continuous_aggregate_policy('temperature_summary_minute',
     start_offset => INTERVAL '1 month',
     end_offset => INTERVAL '1 minute',
     schedule_interval => INTERVAL '1 minute');

GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO dashboard;

DROP MATERIALIZE VIEW temperature_summary_minute;
----

== Just testing

[source,sql]
----
SELECT ts, metric, avg(temp) FROM (

SELECT time_bucket('10s',"time") AS ts, device_id as metric, avg(avg(temperature)) OVER w as temp
FROM temperatures
WHERE
  "time" BETWEEN now() - INTERVAL '5m' AND NOW() AND
  device_id = 'device1'
GROUP BY ts, time, device_id
WINDOW w as (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY time RANGE '1 minute'::INTERVAL PRECEDING)
ORDER BY ts, device_id

) grouped_temps
GROUP BY ts, metric
;
