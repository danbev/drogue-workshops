= Making changes

Now that we have a LoRaWAN based end-to-end example, we are ready to make some changes.

As mentioned earlier, it may happen that the device misses its downlink message from the cloud. However, it wouldn't
be a problem if the device would _phone home_ on a regular basisfootnote:[True, there are other ways to deal with this
as well].

== Making plans

Instead of publishing once when the user presses a button, let's change the logic of the device in way that it
periodically sends some data. This might be a more realistic scenario anyway, periodically sending gathered telemetry
data, instead of waiting for a user to press a button.

However, we need to be careful: LoRaWAN isn't intended to constantly send data. First of all, the usage policy restricts
you from doing so. Second, this is bad for power consumption and thus for the battery.

The Things Network limits downlink messages to a few per day. So we also cannot always send a downlink message, like
we currently do it, when the button is pressed.

Here is what we need to change:

* The device needs to report the state of the LED to the cloud too.
* The device needs to periodically _phone home_
* The cloud side application needs to evaluate if the state of the device's LED is in the desired state.
* If not, it needs to send out a command to the device to alter its state, but only in this case.

== Changing the cloud side

Let prepare the cloud side first.

All that we need to do is to change the `Processor` class:

[source,java]
----
// first we split the payload
var parts = event.getPayload().split(",");

// then we check if the payload is, what we expect...
if (parts.length != 2 || !parts[0].startsWith("ping:") || !parts[1].startsWith("led:")) {
    // .. if not, return with no command
    return null;
}

// check if the configured response is about the LED, and if it matches ...
if (!this.response.startsWith("led:") || parts[1].equals(this.response)) {
    // ... it is not, or it matches, so we return with no command
    return null;
}

// if we end up here, we need to update the device
LOG.info("Need to update device state");
----

== Changing the device

On the device side, we need to add a _ticker_. Take a look at the file `main.rs`, and make the following changes:

[source,rust,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
use drogue_device::{
    actors::button::*,
    *actors::ticker::*,* <1>
    drivers::led::*,
    drivers::lora::sx127x::*,
â€¦
}
*use embassy::time::Duration;* <2>
----
<1> Import the ticker actor.
<2> Import the `Duration` struct.

[source,rust,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
#[derive(Device)]
pub struct MyDevice {
    lora: ActorContext<'static, LoraActor<Sx127x<'static>>>,
    button: ActorContext<'static, Button<'static, ExtiPin<PB2<Input<PullUp>>>, MyApp>>,
    app: ActorContext<'static, MyApp>,
    *ticker: ActorContext<'static, Ticker<'static, MyApp>>,* <1>
}
----
<1> Add an actor context for the ticker

Next, initialize the ticker for the device:

[source,rust,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
context.configure(MyDevice {
    app: ActorContext::new(App::new(AppInitConfig {
        tx_led: led2,
        green_led: led1,
        init_led: led4,
        user_led: led3,
        lora: Some(config),
    })),
    lora: ActorContext::new(LoraActor::new(lora)),
    button: ActorContext::new(Button::new(pin)),
    *ticker: ActorContext::new(Ticker::new(Duration::from_secs(60), Command::Send)),* <1>
});
----
<1> Add the ticker, and configure it so send the `Command::Send` event every 60 seconds.

Now that the ticker takes care of sending the uplink message, we need to decouple this from the button push event. In
the file `app.rs`, make the following changes:

[source,rust,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
fn from(event: ButtonEvent) -> Option<Command> {
    match event {
        ButtonEvent::Pressed => None,
        *ButtonEvent::Released => Some(Command::Tick),* <1>
    }
}
----
<1> When the button is released, send `Command::Tick` only.

Next, we change the context which is sent to the cloud. We simply append the LED state at the end of the current
message:

[source,rust,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
let mut tx = String::<heapless::consts::U32>::new();
*let led = match self.config.user_led.state().unwrap_or_default() {
    true => "on",
    false => "off",
};* <1>
write!(&mut tx, *"ping:{},led:{}*", self.counter, led).ok(); <2>
log::info!("Message: {}", &tx);
let tx = tx.into_bytes();
----
<1> Generate the current state as a string.
<2> Append the string to uplink message, using the prefix `led:`.

After making those changes, you should be able to compile and flash the firmware again using:

[source]
----
cargo run --release
----

== Making tests

Pretty easy, wasn't it? Noticed the bit of string handling on device side. And still, we are 100% sure we didn't create
any memory leaks or invalid pointer access in the process thanks to Rust.

So after the device is flashed, let's sit back and watch the device _phone home_. Make some change to the LED state,
and watch the logs. The LED should change. But, you only see the message `Need to update device state` in the logs,
when there was a mismatch between the actual and the desired state of the LED.

== Further ideas

Now it is time to come up with your own ideas. You could:

* Switch from sending string to some binary format, to make your LoRa messages more efficient.
* You could come up with some more elaborate processing on the cloud side. Maybe tie in some external service for
evaluating the _desired_ state of the LED.
* Attach a sensor to the device, and send some real data.
