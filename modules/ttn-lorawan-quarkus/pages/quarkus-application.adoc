= Quarkus application

The last piece of the puzzle is a customer provided application. The application that wants to talk to the device, in
order to provide some value-add.

For implementing this, we choose Quarkus. Java is great for business applications, there are plenty of tutorials on
how to build and interface Quarkus application with enterprise systems. So in this workshop, we will focus on bridging
the gap between enterprise and IoT.

The core idea here is that you use Drogue IoT cloud as a service. That means, we don't plan on deploying our application
inside the same cluster, but on a separate machine or cluster. Technically you can still do that! We just try to follow
a more "as-a-service" approach, and you might see in a minute, that this also makes things easier, as you can run
the application in your local machine, use our sandbox, and still be connected to the public TTN network.

We will be using the MQTT integration of Drogue IoT. This makes things easy, as we don't need to bridge two Kafka
clusters, and still can have multiple consumers. Also, it is possible to just re-use all your tools around MQTT that
you already may know about, for testing and debugging.

== Creating a Drogue IoT cloud API key

In order to get access to the application through the MQTT integration, we need an OAuth token or API key. As you need
to periodically refresh an OAuth token, and most MQTT clients have no idea about that, we choose an API key
herefootnote:[API keys don't expire, while OAuth access tokens do. Even when you can refresh an access token using
a refresh token, you still need to do this.].

Getting a new API key currently requires to use a command line HTTP client, like HTTPie or curl. It is a simple
operation though, and we will use `drg whoami --token` to acquire a fresh OAuth token for accessing the API.

The following examples require you to replace `<api-endpoint>` with the actual API endpoint. You can get this from
the web console, from the page named "Home":

image::api-endpoint.png[Screenshot home page showing the API endpoint information]

The API endpoint URL is located in the box "API" in the "Services" column.

NOTE: The following examples will use the command `jq` to pretty-format that the JSON result of the commands. If can't
use `jq`, you can also omit it as is it only used to improve readability of the result.

=== Create a new API key

[source]
----
curl -vs -H "Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami --token)" -XPOST <api-endpoint>/api/keys/v1alpha1 | jq
----

The output should look something like:
[source,json]
----
{
  "prefix": "drg_g0yAUq",
  "key": "drg_g0yAUq_kwjRLA40hrt81bbKdGbcDOmlq2WASx6UyQi"
}
----

The value of the field `key` is the actual API key. You will not be able to recover this key at a later time. So
you need to note (copy) it somewhere. The "prefix" is used to identity the key, so that you can easily delete it
later on.

=== List API keys

You can also list your existing API keys using:

[source]
----
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami --token)" <api-endpoint>/api/keys/v1alpha1 | jq
----

Which should provide you can output like:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "prefix": "drg_g0yAUq",
    "created": "2021-04-28T08:42:59.336402353Z"
  }
]
----

As you can see, the actual `key` is no longer part of the result.

=== Deleting API keys

If you need to delete a key, you can easily achieve this using the `DELETE` verb:

[source]
----
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami --token)" -XDELETE <api-endpoint>/api/keys/v1alpha1/drg_g0yAUq
----

=== Finding your username

In addition to the API key, you will also need to know your username.

You can check your username using the Web Console. In the top right corner of the console, you will find the user menu,
which shows you your username:

== Preparing the application

While we provide a ready to run container of this application, this workshop plans to make changes to the source code.

TIP: While all the following steps are possible without an IDE, you may wish to set up of your favorite IDE alongside
the process. The tutorial doesn't require any IDE specific settings or tasks, everything could be done using plain
Maven and the most basic text editor. But, feel free to make yourself comfortable.

We will start directly by cloning the source code of this example, and run it locally:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/drogue-iot/quarkus-mqtt-integration-example
----

Next, we need to insert the parameters for connecting the application to the MQTT integration:

Create the file `src/main/resources/application-dev.properties` and add the following content:

[source]
----
drogue.application.name=my-app <1>
drogue.api.user=my-username <2>
drogue.api.key=drg_g0yAUq_3z5pasdcasdeI4YqOP123hdsa821VAtFs4x <3>
drogue.integration.mqtt.host=mqtt-integration.sandbox.drogue.cloud <4>
drogue.integration.mqtt.port=443 <5>
----
<1> The Drogue IoT application name
<2> Your Drogue IoT username, as described in <<Finding your username>>
<3> Your Drogue IoT application key, as described in <<Create a new API key>>
<4> The hostname of the MQTT integration.
<5> The port number of the MQTT integration.
+
While `443` might look strange here for MQTT, it will still work in the
case of OpenShift, as _OpenShift routes_ patch through TLS based TCP connections directly through to the endpoint.

== Testing the setup

You can now start the application, https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started#running-the-application[like any other Quarkus application]:

[source]
----
mvn quarkus:dev
----

The output should look something like:

[source,subs="verbatim,macros"]

The application will keep running until you terminate it, by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C].

== Testing it out

Navigate your browser to the web console, as shows in the previous step's log output. It should look something like:

image::demo-app-1.png[Screenshot of Quarkus application]

Once you press the blue button on the board, you should see an incoming message, and with that, an outgoing message too.

image::demo-app-2.png[Screenshot of Quarkus application]

Try changing the response to `led:on`, and press the blue button again. The blue LED on the board should turn on, once
the green, send indicator, LED turns off again.

[NOTE]
====
It may be that the blue LED doesn't turn on. Give it a second try, by pressing the blue button again.

Why is that needed? A short period after the uplink (device-to-cloud) message, the LoRa device switches into receive
mode, awaiting an optional downlink (cloud-to-device) message. If that time window is missed, then the device will
not receive the downlink message, and go back to sleep. We will deal with this later, so read on.

== Understanding the code

Let's take a quick tour through the code.


=== Processing

The main logic is in class `io.drogue.iot.demo.Processor`, and it is actually pretty simple:

[source,java]
----
@Incoming("event-stream") <1>
@Outgoing("device-commands") <2>
@Broadcast <3>
public DeviceCommand process(DeviceEvent event) {

    var payload = event.getPayload();

    LOG.info("Received payload: {}", payload);

    if (!event.getPayload().startsWith("ping:")) {
        return null;
    }

    var command = new DeviceCommand();

    command.setDeviceId(event.getDeviceId());
    command.setPayload(this.response.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

    return command; <4>

}
----
<1> Annotation for consuming messages from the `event-stream` channel.
<2> Annotation for delivering messages, coming out of this method, to the `device-commands` channel.
<3> Indication that all consumers of the `device-commands` channel should receive the event.
+
This is required so that all browsers that are attached to the web frontend, and the device will receive the event.
<4> The actual message we generated and want to send out.

=== Receiving events

The processing part already expects messages of the type `DeviceEvent`. This is an application specific Java message,
which we don't send out in Drogue cloud.

The conversion takes place in the class `io.drogue.iot.demo.integration.Receiver`.

It will take the incoming MQTT message, which is a Cloud Events message in https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.1/mqtt-protocol-binding.md#13-content-modes[structured content mode], as with Quarkus, we are using MQTT v3.

We decode the data section as a JSON encoded TTN uplink message, and extract the payload from it.

As with the `Processor` class before, the return the processed (converted) message. The returned message will be
sent to the `event-stream`, so that both the `Processor` and any attached web browser will receive it.

=== Sending commands

The output of the `Processor` will be received by the `io.drogue.iot.demo.integration.Sender` class.

This class will construct the MQTT message, which contains the command for the device. It will publish this as an
MQTT message, which will then be forwarded by Drogue cloud to the command endpoint for the device. Which in our case
here is the downlink API of The Things Network.
