= LoRaWAN end-to-end

This workshop focuses on the use case of reporting data from an embedded device, to the cloud, and receive commands
back.

The idea is that you have some embedded device, with a LoRa modem, periodically reporting data to the cloud, and
occasionally receiving back commands to control the device.

Instead of implementing all the LoRa infrastructure ourselves, we re-use the infrastructure of
https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/[The Things Network] (TTN). However, we will want to process the data as part of our
Drogue Cloud setup.

[IMPORTANT]
.Drogue Cloud version
====
This workshop requires the (yet) unreleased version of Drogue IoT Cloud 0.5. The sandbox will only be
updated once 0.5 is released. But, you can still use the "devbox" at https://console-drogue-dev.apps.wonderful.iot-playground.org/
====

== Pre-requisites

This workshop requires additional hardware, as we need an embedded device with a LoRa modem.

Additionally to the common pre-requisites, you will need:

* A Drogue Device supported development board and LoRa modem
* Coverage for "The Things Network"
* A "The Things Network" v3 account
* A publicly accessible Drogue IoT Cloud instance running version 0.5+
* Standard Java development tools: Java, Maven, Git

=== Supported embedded device & LoRa modem

Ideally, you have the https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html[STM32L0 discovery kit for LoRa]
(B-L072Z-LRWAN1). This kit has a Drogue Device supported STM32 board, and also has an SX1276 modem, for which
Drogue Device has a LoRa driver.

You may also use a different Drogue Device supported board, adding the SX1276 using SPI. However, this means
that you need to adapt the provided example firmware yourself.

=== The Things Network coverage

You can think of TTN as your LoRa network provider. When your device wants to send over the TTN LoRa network, you
need to ensure that you have network coverage. So you can check if your region is already covered. The good thing with
TTN is, if your region is not covered, you can take care of this yourself.

For this you will need to buy (or lend) a LoRa gateway. The LoRa gateway will open a local LoRa network cell, and
connect via TCP/IP to the TTN LoRa network backend.

LoRa gateways come in various flavors. You can build one yourself with a Raspberry Pi, you can go all-in and buy an
industrial, rugged version, mounting this to your roof and cover some kmÂ² with LoRa. Or, you can go on the cheap side
and simply buy the
https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/thethingsindoor/index.html[The Things Indoor Gateway (TTIG)].

=== Publicly accessible Drogue Cloud version

This time, you cannot run Drogue Cloud on your local machine. The Things Network will need to reach out to your machine,
in order to deliver events to Drouge Cloud. For this you need a publicly available instance.
