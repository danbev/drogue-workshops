= Node.js application

The last piece of the puzzle is a customer provided application. The application
 that wants to talk to the device, in order to provide some value-add.

For this implementing we choose Node.js. There are plenty of tutorials on
Node.js how to build and interface Node.js application. So in this workshop, we
will focus on bridging the gap between enterprise and IoT.

The core idea here is that you use Drogue IoT Cloud as a service. That means, we
don't plan on deploying our application inside the same cluster, but on a
separate machine or cluster. Technically you can still do that! We just try to
follow a more "as-a-service" approach, and you might see in a minute, that this
also makes things easier, as you can run the application on your local machine,
or use our sandbox, and still be connected to the public TTN network.

We will be using the MQTT integration of Drogue IoT. This makes things easy, as
we don't need to bridge two Kafka clusters, and still can have multiple
consumers. Also, it is possible to just re-use all your tools around MQTT that
you already may know about, for testing and debugging.

== Creating a Drogue IoT cloud API token

In order to get access to the application through the MQTT integration, we need
an OAuth token or API token. As you need to periodically refresh an OAuth token,
and most MQTT clients have no idea about that, we choose an API token
herefootnote:[API tokens don't expire, while OAuth access tokens do. Even when you can refresh an access token using
a refresh token, you still need to do this.].

Getting a new API token currently requires to use a command line HTTP client,
like HTTPie or curl. It is a simple operation though, and we will use
`drg whoami --token` to acquire a fresh OAuth token for accessing the API.

The following examples require you to replace `<api-endpoint>` with the actual
API endpoint. You can get this from the web console, from the page named "Home":

image::api-endpoint.png[Screenshot home page showing the API endpoint information]

The API endpoint URL is located in the box "API" in the "Services" column.

NOTE: The following examples will use the command `jq` to pretty-format that the JSON result of the commands. If can't
use `jq`, you can also omit it as is it only used to improve readability of the result.

=== Create a new API token

[source]
----
curl -vs -H "Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami --token)" -XPOST <api-endpoint>/api/tokens/v1alpha1 | jq
----

The output should look something like:
[source,json]
----
{
  "prefix": "drg_g0yAUq",
  "token": "drg_g0yAUq_kwjRLA40hrt81bbKdGbcDOmlq2WASx6UyQi"
}
----

The value of the field `token` is the actual API token. You will not be able to
recover this token at a later time. So you need to note (copy) it somewhere. The
"prefix" is used to identity the token, so that you can easily delete it
later on.

=== List API tokens

You can also list your existing API tokens using:

[source]
----
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami --token)" <api-endpoint>/api/tokens/v1alpha1 | jq
----

Which should provide you can output like:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "prefix": "drg_g0yAUq",
    "created": "2021-04-28T08:42:59.336402353Z"
  }
]
----

As you can see, the actual `token` is no longer part of the result.

=== Deleting API tokens

If you need to delete a token, you can easily achieve this using the `DELETE` verb:

[source]
----
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(drg whoami --token)" -XDELETE <api-endpoint>/api/tokens/v1alpha1/drg_g0yAUq
----

=== Finding your username

In addition to the API token, you will also need to know your username.

You can check your username using the Web Console. In the top right corner of
the console, you will find the user menu, which shows you your username:

== Preparing the application

While we provide a ready to run container of this application, this workshop
plans to make changes to the source code.

We will start directly by cloning the source code of this example, and run it
locally:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/drogue-iot/nodejs-mqtt-integration-example
----

Next, we need to insert the parameters for connecting the application to the
MQTT integration:

Copy the file `config_sample.json` into a file named `config.json` and change
the following field:

[source, json]
----
{
  "drogue.application.name": "<drogue_cloud_app_name>", <1>
  "drogue.api.user": "<drogue_cloud_username>", <2>
  "drogue.api.token": "<drogue_cloud_api_token>", <3>
  "drogue.integration.mqtt.host": "mqtts://mqtt-integration.sandbox.drogue.cloud",<4>
  "drogue.integration.mqtt.port": 443 <5>
}
----
<1> The Drogue IoT application name
<2> Your Drogue IoT username, as described in <<Finding your username>>
<3> Your Drogue IoT application token, as described in <<Create a new API token>>
<4> The hostname of the MQTT integration.
<5> The port number of the MQTT integration.
+
While `443` might look strange here for MQTT, it will still work in the
case of OpenShift, as _OpenShift routes_ patch through TLS based TCP connections directly through to the endpoint.

== Testing the setup

Install the application:

[source]
----
nvm install
----

Start the application:

[source,subs="verbatim,macros"]
----
$ npm start

> nodejs-mqtt-integration-example@1.0.0 start
> node --no-warnings index.js

Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080 <1>
Connected to mqtts://mqtt-integration.sandbox.drogue.cloud <2>
----
<1> The URL to the web user interface for this example
<2> Note the line "Connected to" showing that the example as connected to Drogue IoT Cloud

The application will keep running until you terminate it, by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+C].

== Testing it out

Navigate your browser to the web console, as shows in the previous step's log
output. It should look something like:

image::nodejs-demo-app-1.png[Screenshot of Node.js application]

Once you press the blue button on the board, you should see an incoming message,
and with that, an outgoing message too.

image::nodejs-demo-app-2.png[Screenshot of Node.js application]

Try changing the response to `led:on`, and press the blue button again. The blue
LED on the board should turn on, once the green send indicator LED turns off
again.

[NOTE]
====
It may be that the blue LED doesn't turn on. Give it a second try, by pressing
the blue button again.

Why is that needed? A short period after the uplink (device-to-cloud) message,
the LoRa device switches into receive mode, awaiting an optional downlink
 (cloud-to-device) message. If that time window is missed, then the device will
not receive the downlink message, and go back to sleep. We will deal with this
later, so read on.
====

== Understanding the code

Let's take a quick tour through the code.

The entry point of the application is `index.js` which configures and starts
a HTTP server, and a MQTT client.

=== Processing

The http server serves content from the `static` directory which contains
an `index.html` file which is shown rendered in the above screenshots. This
file contains a `script` element which uses Server Sent Events (SSE) to allow
the server to send updates to it. In addition to serving the static content the
httpserver is also written to handle the sending of events (SSE). The server is
built using https://www.fastify.io[Fastify] and the SSE handling is provided
using https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastify-sse[fastify-sse].

The MQTT client is used to subscribe to device uplink events, and is also used
to publish downlink events.

In `lib/mqtt-client.js` we have the following function:
[source,javascript]
----
  client.on('message', (receiveTopic, message) => { <1>
    const json = JSON.parse(message);
    const framePayload = Buffer.from(json.data.uplink_message.frm_payload, 'base64');

    const event = {
      deviceId: json.device,
      timestamp: json.time,
      payload: framePayload.toString('utf8')
    };
    sse.sendMessageEvent(event); <2>

    if (event.payload.startsWith('ping')) {
      const command = {
        deviceId: event.deviceId,
        payload: getPayload(event, sse)
      };
      sse.updateResponse(sse.lastResponse); <3>
      sse.sendCommandEvent(command); <4>

      const sendTopic = `command/${appName}/${command.deviceId}/port:1`;
      const responsePayload = Buffer.from(command.payload, 'utf8');
      client.publish(sendTopic, responsePayload, {qos: QOS_AT_LEAST_ONCE}); <5>
    }
  });
----
<1> Function for handling messages from the subscribed Drogue IoT Cloud app topic.
<2> Send SSE event for `Last Message` part of the UI (left section of the UI).
<3> Send SSE event for `Response` part of the UI (middle section of the UI).
<4> Send SSE event for `Latest Command` part of the UI (right section of the UI).
<5> Publishes/sends a downlink command to the Drogue IoT Cloud to Device topic.
