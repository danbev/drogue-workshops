= Running locally

The next step is to run this locally.

== Getting the source code

Go to https://github.com/drogue-iot/quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter[drogue-iot/quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter] on
GitHub and fork the repository. It is a template repository, which allows you to easily create a copy of it. This allows
you to make and push changes to your own copy, and is required for other parts of the workshop.

You can easily do this by making a copy:

Choose a name, and then clone the repository on your local machine.

[NOTE]
.Repository location
====
The following commands and examples will still use the original HTTP link to the repository.

If you created a copy, please be sure to adapt the name accordingly.
====

On your local machine, you can clone the source using the `git` command line tool like this:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/drogue-iot/quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter
----

== Which IDE/editor to use?

This is completely up to you! Quarkus works together with all kinds of IDEs and editors.

In the following sections we will focus on command line usage of tools, like `mvn`. You know your environment best,
so if you dislike using the command line, you can always use equivalent IDE operations instead.

== Starting locally

Quarkus applications can be started locally by executing the following command, and this application is no different:

[source]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
----

This will compile and run the application in debug mode. Beside the Maven build output, you should see the
application's log output in the end:

[source]
----
[INFO] No sources to compile

----

The command will not return to the shell, you need to abort the command using kbd:[Ctrl+C]

Watch out for a line like this:

----

The transition to `CONNECTED` shows, that the MQTT connection has been establishes successfully.

After that, a line like the following should appear too:

[source]

This indicates a received message, including its payload, in binary format. But you can already see that the message
has been successfully decoded as a "CloudEvent". The metadata of the cloud event already gives a bit of information
what the event is about.

== One small step â€¦

This already was the first step. You can take your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 and should see
the same dashboard that the sandbox hosts.

== What's next?

Now it is time to understand what is going on under the hood. And get ready to make some first changes.
