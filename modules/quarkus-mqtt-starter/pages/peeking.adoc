= What to expect?

As mentioned before, we actually host the application on your sandbox cluster too. You can take a look at https://quarkus-mqtt-integration-starter-drogue-quarkus-demos.apps.wonderful.iot-playground.org/

On this page, you should see a dashboard like shown in the following screenshot:

== What do you see?

This dashboard shows the most recent received message from any device. If the message contained geolocation information,
then it will also put a marker on the map. Only one marker will be shown at a time, so a new marker will replace
any previous markers.

The data comes from a publicly available data stream, hosted on the Drogue IoT sandbox cluster.

You can subscribe to that data stream with a simple MQTT client yourself.

== What's next?

Here? Not much! Now it is up to you to replicate this.
