= Toolchain setup

In order to create a device firmware, you will need to set up an embedded toolchain for Rust.

== Install `rustup`

In order to install Rust and Rust components, you will need https://rustup.rs/[rustup]:

On Unix-like environment, the following command should work just fine:

[source]
----
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
----

There are other ways to install `rustup`. Check its homepage to learn more.

== Install an embedded toolchain

By default, `rustup` will install a toolchain (compiler, â€¦) for your current host architecture and operating system.

However, when compiling a device firmware, we need to have a compiler for a different architecture (CPU). You can
install additional toolchains on your machine. Execute the following command to install a toolchain for a Cortex-M
style board:

[source]
----
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
----

In many cases, you will also need a "nightly" (unreleased) version of the Rust compiler. You can easily install
this in addition to the stable version be executing:

[source]
----
rustup +nightly target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
----

NOTE: The nightly version of the compiler must be explicitly enabled. When installing it, it will not become the default.
So, there is no harm in installing a nightly version.

== Additional tools

In addition to the actual toolchain, you will need tools to flash the firmware to your device, and to monitor what
is going on.

There are a few tools for Rust which can help here. However, we will focus on the https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run[probe-run].

You can install `probe-run` be executing the following command:

[source]
----
cargo install probe-run
----
